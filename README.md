## ML In Programming (pre-chatgpt)


Using AI to create tools for programmers 


1. The Case for Learned Index Structures 
2. https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Machine-Learning-in-Compilers-Past-Present-and-Future.pdf
3. Semantic Code Search by Github: https://towardsdatascience.com/semantic-code-search-3cd6d244a39c
4. Automatic Recommendation of Pythonic Idiom Usage - https://youtu.be/vOCQReSvBxA
5. Using machine learning for code recommendation : https://ai.facebook.com/blog/aroma-ml-for-code-recommendation/
6. Deep learning to translate between programming languages https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deep-learning-to-translate-between-programming-languages/
7. More broadly, AI has the potential to help with other programming tasks. For example, Facebook AI has previously shared Neural Code Search, a method for using natural language in queries about code, and Getafix, a tool that learns to automatically suggest fixes for coding bugs. 
8. Introducing TF-Coder, a tool that writes tricky TensorFlow expressions for you!
